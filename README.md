<h1>Finite State Automata Generator<h1>
  
Generates a Finite State Automata given correct input statements. This will not only draw the diagram, but also displays an animation for the user to see the finite state automata through its progression.

Provided in the files is a legal and illegal statements for the finite state automata to parse and display a computation model that can potientally be implemented with hardware or software. This is used to simulate sequential logic in computer programs. The terminal will display if the finite state automata given is legal or not.
